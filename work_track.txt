I am having issues getting the slackclient to work in my python script. So far the documentation has been at odds with itself, plus I am very unfamiliar with working with APIs/Tokens. I will have to take the API course on Udacity :: https://www.udacity.com/course/designing-restful-apis--ud388

added/updated a general portcheck script that I had written a little while ago. I still need to get back to the slackclient work, but lately have been hamstrung with DB issues at work. I will get at it when I find the time (maybe a month or two).

Wrote an SSH session detector that filters and reports opened sessions from unknown IP addresses. Future work I would like to add bot functionality in Slack to hit the ipstack.com api and pull information on the IPs. It would also be interesting to do connection detection in real time.
